<h1>How to care for your houseplants</h1>

<p>Still unsure how to keep plants alive in your home? Use this beginners guide, with tips on watering, positioning and propagating from a homeowner who is just started cultivating her green fingers</p><br>


<h2>Be water wise </h2>

<p>Overwatering is the thing most of us get wrong. Make sure your pots have drainage holes so plants do not end up sitting in water, and aim to keep soil moist rather than wet.</p><br>

<h2>Help your cuttings take root </h2><br>

<p>Sit your cutting in water so it can grow roots. Just water, you do not need to add anything. But change the water every two to three days to keep it fresh. When roots appear, pot your cutting in soil (do not use too big a pot). Get special potting soil as normal soil is too nutrient rich and will end up burning the baby plants roots.</p>

<h2>Pick the perfect position</h2><br>

<p>Work out how the light moves around your home and pick plants to match its sunspots and shady corners, humidity levels and temperature. And if a plant gets sick?  You usually need to cut it back, cut off the bit that is unhealthy and then see what happens.</p>

<h2>Create the right growing conditions</h2>

<p>The main thing about repotting is not to use too big a pot. Just go up one size. I gently tip the plant out of its old pot and remove a little of the soil. In a bowl I mix one part soil with one part gravel. It is a mix that is not too dense so there is room for the plants roots to grow, and water dose not get clogged up. You can add in some VÃ„XER stone wool plugs to boost the drainage.</p>
